<h2>Metaplot of HERV-TFBSs</h2>
<p>A metaplot of HERV-TFBSs on a consensus sequence of the HERV/LR type. The x-axis indicates nucleotide positions of the consensus sequence. The y-axis indicates number of HERV/LR copies harboring HERV-TFBSs at that position.</p>

<h2>Metaplot of TF-binding motifs in TFBSs</h2>
<p>A metaplot of TF-binding motifs present in HERV-TFBSs on consensus sequence of the HERV/LR type. The x-axis indicates nucleotide positions of the consensus sequence. The y-axis indicates number of HERV/LR copies harboring the binding motifs at that position. Peaks of TF-binding motifs corresponding to HCREs are shown with asterisks and motif names.</p>

<h2>Metaplot of HERV-DHSs</h2>
<p>A metaplot of HERV-DHSs (overlaps between HERV/LRs and DHSs) on consensus sequence of the HERV/LR type. The x-axis indicates nucleotide positions of the consensus sequence. The y-axis indicates number of HERV/LR copies harboring HERV-DHSs at that position.</p>

<h2>Overlaps of HERV/LRs with each chromatin state</h2>
<p>Proportion of HERV/LR copies overlapped to each chromatin state predicted by chromatin segmentation. TSS; promoter region including TSS, PF; predicted promoter flanking region, E; enhancer, WE; weak enhancer or open chromatin cis regulatory element, CTCF; CTCF enriched element, T; transcribed region, R; repressed or low activity region.</p>
