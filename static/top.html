<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Human endogenous retroviruses and other LTR type retrotransposons (HERV/LRs) have their own regulatory elements possibly affecting on transcriptions of host genes. dbHERV-REs is a database for regulatory elements of these HERV/LRs. The dbHERV-REs particularly focuses on HERV/LRs Conserved Regulatory Elements (HCREs), regulatory elements conserved among HERV/LRs copies belonging to the same type of HERV/LRs. Besides above, this database provides phylogenetic tree of each HERV/LR type, and so you can compare phylogenetic subgroup in a particular HERV/LR type and presence or absence of HCREs. If you want to know about this database in detail, please check our paper (REF).</p>
